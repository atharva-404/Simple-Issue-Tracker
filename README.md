## Backend

- Developed with **FastAPI**.  
- Provides REST API endpoints for managing issues:

| Endpoint        | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|
| `GET /health`   | Returns server status |
| `GET /issues`   | List issues with search, filters, sorting, pagination |
| `GET /issues/{id}` | Get a single issue by ID |
| `POST /issues`  | Create a new issue |
| `PUT /issues/{id}` | Update an existing issue |

- See `backend/README.md` for detailed instructions to run the backend.  
- Backend default URL: `http://localhost:8000`

## Frontend

- Developed with **Angular** (standalone components).  
- Connects to backend API to display and manage issues.
